  When sending an email using the "Tell a Friend" functionality for personal
  campaign pages this change makes it so you can choose whether the email should
  come from the default email for the organization OR the contact IDs email
  address. Before this change the emails would always go out from the contact
  which can break SPF/DMARC and lead to bounced/failed email delivery.  

- **[CRM-20845](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20845) create
  alterMailingRecipients hook
  ([10673](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/10673))**

  E-mail' Activities Editable

  Email", this change adds two new permissions 'edit inbound email basic
  information' and 'edit inbound email basic information and content' users with
  these permissions can edit activities of type "Inbound Email".
