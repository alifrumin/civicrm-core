- **Make DAO fields more consistent
  ([14072](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14072))**

  This PR makes is so the 'where' field is populated regardless of whether
  import or export is set. The goal of this pr is to simplify some of the
  metadata based magic by trying to get the meaning of import & export closer to
  the original intent.

- **Hook to alter menubar css variables & fix breakpoint in WP
  ([14135](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14135))**

  Makes the menubar more flexible and configurable by adding a hook to alter it
  and fixes a couple issues with the menubar in Wordpress at certain breakpoints
  by implementing the hook internally.

- **Replace jcalendar instances with datepicker
  ([dev/core#561](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/561):
  [14150](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14150) and
  [14099](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14099)) CONTINUES WORK**

  Moves towards using datepicker instead of jcalendar on the Campaign search
  form and for Pledges.

- **Result filter criteria doesn't show IS NULL/IS NOT NULL for operations
  ([dev/core#865](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/865):
  [14028](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14028))**

  Allow users to access to the operations `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` when
  choosing filter criteria.

- **Allow url to set IS NULL/ NOT NULL in report for operations
  ([dev/core#876](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/876):
  [14052](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14052))**

  Allow IS NULL/ NOT NULL for filters like campaign (added by
  [14028](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14028)) to be passed via
  url.

- **Convert dedupe select to select 2 and remove not-used var
  ([14161](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14161))**

  On the Dedupe rules form, converts the field to select from a select to a
  select2.

- **Add function filterLinks to return an array of links for an entity that can
  be used by the API / form layer to generate a link
  ([14112](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14112))**

  Adds the function filterLinks (CRM_Core_Action::filterLinks()) which can be
  used to generate link html client-side. This function is currently unused.

- **Add serialize metadata to tag used_for field
  ([14096](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14096))**

  Add schema metadata to the Tag "used_for" field, which is a comma separated

  ([14085](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14085))**

  most up to date documentation.  

- **Add pseudoconstant to UFField dao
  ([14041](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14041))**

  Improves the UFField api by exposing the option list for the field
  `fieldname`, before this change it was displayed as a text_field instead of a
  select.

### CiviCase

- **Long running sql queries from CiviCase
  ([dev/core#832](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/832):
  [14139](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14139))**

- **Make hook_civicrm_pre() and hook_civicrm_post() fire on CaseContacts

  Makes it so extension developers can use hook_civicrm_pre() and
  hook_civicrm_post() on CaseContacts.

### CiviContribute

- **Call Payment.create from payment.cancel
  ([13689](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13689))**

  amounts and moves the Payment.cancel api to use the Payment.create api instead
  of a bespoke function.

  [14044](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14044)) WORK TOWARDS**

  This furthers the goal of allowing users to A/B test subject lines in Mosaico
  by allowing extension developers to dynamically wrap an API.

### Drupal Integration

- **Drupal Views : relationships for standard groups
  ([CRM-20006](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20006):
  [507](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/pull/507))**

  ([dev/core#934](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/934):
  [14194](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14194) and
  [14204](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14204))**

  Fixes a regression in core where the activity tab could not be sorted by
  `source_name` so that the activity tab can be sorted by `source_name`.

- **Error randomly appearing when Financial type ACL is enabled
  ([dev/core#918](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/918):
  [14165](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14165) and
  [14168](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14168))**

  Fixes an undefined index error `Undefined index: status in
  CRM_Utils_Check_Component_FinancialTypeAcls::checkFinancialAclReport()` when a
  site has a Financial Type ACL enabled.

- **utf8mb4 warning keeps coming back up
  ([dev/core#880](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/880):
  [14123](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14123))**

  This change makes it so users only receive the Mysql utf8mb4 status check
  once, before this change the status check would show up whenever apache was
  restarted.

  ([dev/core#248](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/248):
  [14134](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14134))**

  ([14083](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14083))**

  Updates the upgrade message "This database uses InnoDB Full Text Search for
  optimized searching. The upgrade procedure has not been tested with this
  feature. You should disable (and later re-enable) the feature by navigating
  to..." to point to the right settings form "Administer => Customize Data and
  Screens => Search Preferences" instead of "Administer => System Settings =>
  Miscellaneous".

- **fix getAddressColumns() to respect tableAlias
  ([14014](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14014))**

  Fixes getAddressColumns()function so that it no longer returns an error when
  used twice.

  [14086](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14086))**

  This change enhances performance of CiviCase by streamlining the Case Activity
  Query which was crashing the server for some sites with large databases by
  producing too many temporary files.

### CiviContribute

- **Create contribution before taking payment, per contribution page workflow
  ([13837](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13837))**

  Makes it so the Contribution is created before the payment processor is
  called, so there is always a contribution record even if payment fails.

### CiviEvent

- **CRM-18570 When creating a new event using a template the new event screen is
  taking the default values directly from the custom fields, and not from what's
  saved in the event template.
  ([dev/core#553](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/553):
  [14063](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14063))**

  Ensures start dates are formatted according to the site's localization
  preference during the Event Cart checkout process.

### CiviMail

- **Fixed double protocol being added in link by CKEditor.
  ([14128](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14128))**

  Fixes a bug where adding action tokens using the CKEditor link interface, and
  then editing them could cause double protocols (ex: http://https:// or
  http://http://).

- **Fix ts() usage in CRM_SMS_Form_Schedule
  ([14111](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14111))**

  Allows translation of the "Send Mass SMS" form.

- **Membership status processor ignoring records where is_override=0
  ([dev/core#881](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/881):
  [14059](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14059))**

  down the column.

  ([dev/membership#9](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/membership/issues/9):
  [14088](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14088))**

  ([14077](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14077))**

### Drupal Integration

- **Civi 5.12.1 renders Quicksearch unreadable on Drupal 8
  ([dev/drupal#56](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/drupal/issues/56):
  [14080](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14080))**

  Fixes a regression where the text in the Quicksearch box was too light to read
  so that it is darker and easier to read.

- **Don't render an empty mailto link for empty email addresses
  ([540](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/pull/540))**

  If you add an 'email address' field to a views display, and choose to output
  it as a mailto link then an empty link is created when the email address is
  empty; with the link of just 'mailto:'. This patch makes a change to ensure
  that an email address is present before outputting a link around it.

- **Column next_sched_contribution should be next_sched_contribution_date for
  Views integration
