### Core CiviCRM

- **[dev/core#635](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/635) Implement
  reconnect/replay-on-write for database connections
  ([13489](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13489),
  [13514](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13514),
  [13496](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13496) and
  [13394](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13394)) Continued Work**

  These changes move towards making CiviCRM compatibility with a split DB
  architecture in which one routes MySQL requests to (a) read-only slave DBs
  and/or (b) read-write master DB. Specifically by implementing a
  "reconnect-on-write" or "replay-on-write" (RPOW) mechanism.

- **[dev/core#561](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/561) Replace
  jcalendar instances with datepicker
  ([13485](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13485),
  [13211](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13211),
  [13422](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13422) and
  [13423](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13423))**

  These changes switch fields that store dates from jcalendar to use the
  datepicker in the following places: the grant task form fields, grant search
  fields, campaign date fields and activity followup form fields.

- **[dev/core#491](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/491) Report results
  don't show inactive campaigns
  ([13382](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13382))**

  This change standardizes the campaign fields offered on the the Activity,
  Member Contriubtion Detail and Member Lapse reports.

- **[dev/core#527](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/527) Non translatable
  fields in profile schema
  ([13185](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13185))**

  This change adds the ability to set translated text for the Submit and Cancel
  buttons on a profile.

- **[dev/core#682](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/682) Add basic
  contact filters to Summary Contributions Report
  ([13498](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13498))**

- **[dev/core#686](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/686) Make "Amount
  Statistics" columns optional on Membership Summary report
  ([13507](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13507))**

### Core CiviCRM

- **[dev/core#434](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/434) Scheduled
  Reminder Error On Using Absolute Date With Repeat
  ([12923](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12923))**

- **[dev/core#506](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/506) Advanced Search:
  There is an error when the user tries to display results as Cases
  ([13480](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13480))**

  This change ensures on the Advanced Search Form the "Display Results As" field
  only shows enabled components.

- **[dev/core#609](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/609) Can't view
  "Advanced Search" links on Mailing Report without "View All Contacts"
  permission ([13390](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13390))**

  This change makes it so that users without the permission "View All Contacts"
  can view the "Advanced Search" links on mailing reports.

- **[dev/core#636](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/636) Custom field for
  Address: The "No" value is not defaulted
  ([13397](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13397))**

  This change ensures that if a contact has selected "No" for an Address custom
  field (of type boolean yes/no), when editing that field it defaults to "No".
  Before this change, if a user had an Address custom field with the value set
  to 0 or False (like "No" does when using a Yes/No boolean) then when editing
  that field it would not appear unfilled.

- **[dev/core#649](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/649) DB error on Find
  Activities with follow up criteria
  ([13420](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13420))**

  "Has a Followup Activity" search field sent to "Yes".

  links ([13421](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13421))**

  This change makes it so that when viewing a membership, when one clicks the
  "View Recurring Contribution" Link it opens as a popup instead of as a new
  page. This change also makes it so that when viewing a Recurring Contribution
  with a membership, when one clicks on the "Membership" it opens in a popup
  instead of a new page.

- **[dev/core#652](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/652) Copying activity

### CiviCase

- **[dev/core#500](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/500) CiviCase:
  dashboard summary count includes cases from inactive relationships
  ([13134](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13134))**

  This change ensures that only active relationships are counted in the summary
  count on the case dashboard.

- **[dev/core#670](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/670) Cases: Edit
  Activity does not save tags
  ([13486](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13486))**

- **[dev/core#681](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/681) - Fatal Error on
  submitting "Change Case Status" activity form.
  ([13497](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13497))**

- **[dev/core#693](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/693) On contact
  summary page, on submitting a 'New Case' form doesn't redirect to 'Manage
  Case' screen ([13527](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13527))**

### CiviContribute

- **[dev/financial#39](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/financial/issues/39)
  Authorize.net doesn't support MD5 hashing at the end of the month
  ([13474](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13474))**

  Authorize.net is phasing out MD5 based transHash element in favor of the SHA-512
  based transHashSHA2. This PR removes the MD5 check in Authorize.net payment
  processor to prevent it from breaking when MD5 based transHash is phased out.

### CiviEvent

- **[dev/core#646](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/646) Event date
  sorting doesn't work for ical listing
  ([13409](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13409))**

  This change ensures that on the ical listing of events, when sorting by event
  dates, the dates get sorted by ASC/DSC for start date instead of alphabetical
  order.

### CiviMail

- **[dev/mail#32](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/mail/issues/32) Deduping test
  email is case sensitive
  ([13401](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13401) and
  [13392](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13392))**

  When composing a mailing, the email address used in the "send test email to"
  field at the bottom is deduped, this change ensures that the deduping is not
  case sensitive so that emails that are the same but have different upper/lower
  case combinations match appropriately.

- **[dev/mail#36](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/mail/issues/36) Bounce processing
  fails for invalid unicode characters
  ([13396](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13396))**

  This change ensures that bounce messages containing invalid unicode characters
  are processed. Before this change an exception was thrown and a bounce was not
  stored in the datebase, but mail was moved to the processed folder. After this
  change: invalid characters are replaced with unicode replacement characters,
  No exception is thrown and the bounce is saved.

- **[dev/mail#37](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/mail/issues/37) Bounce processing
  fails for 4-byte unicode characters
  ([13419](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13419))**

  This change ensures that bounce messages containing 4-byte unicode characters
  are processed appropriately. Before this change when a bounce message
  contained a 4-byte unicode character: an exception was thrown, the bounce was
  not stored in the database, the mail was moved to the processed folder. After
  this change: 4-bytes unicode characters are replaced with unicode replacement
  characters, no exception is thrown and the bounce is saved.
### CiviMember

- **[dev/core#644](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/644) "From" address
  on membership renewal notices is wrong
  ([13408](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13408) and
  [13407](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13407))**

  This change ensures Membership renewal notifications are sent "From" the
  logged-in users name and email. Before thsi change the "From" was set as the
  logged in users contact id.

### Drupal Integration

- **[dev/drupal#43](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/drupal/issues/43) Drupal8:
  composer requires psr/log ~1.0.0, incompatible with psr/log 1.1.0
  ([13424](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13424))**

  This change updates the civicrm-cxn-rpc and psr/log requirements so that they
  are a compatible with Drupal8.

- **[dev/core#381](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/381)
  civicrm/file/imagefile serving up wrong images
  ([542](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/pull/542))**

  This change fixes a bug where files saved in CiviCRM with ids and event ids
  were not loading properly in drupal views.
