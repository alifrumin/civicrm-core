  case relationships in Contact Summary page
  ([13189](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13189))**

  case relationship. This icon is linked to the case so one can easily access
  the case from the relationship and helps to denote that the relationship is
  related to a case.

- **Cache case count when getting list of cases so query is executed once
  instead of three times
  ([13368](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13368))**

  users in MonoLingual mode "UI Languages". Configuring this setting results in
  the Language Switcher block being shown (same as in multilingual mode).

  This change standardizes the permissioning of CiviCase so that users with the
  permission "access my cases and activities" or "access all cases and
  activities" can view appropriate case activities. Before this change the
  permissions needed to view case activities were inconsistent.

- **[dev/core#603](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/603) DB error on Case
