### CiviCRM API

- **[CRM-21803](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21803) Standardise
  ParticipantPayment api to support custom data
  ([11718](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11718))**

  The ParticipantPayment API now uses the standard api function, this has the
  added bonus of allowing this api to support custom data.

- **Fix relationshipType, paymentProcessorType, Note & jobLog apis to support
  custom data ([11721](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11721))**

  Updates the relationshipType, paymentProcessorType & jobLog apis to support custom data.

- **[CRM-21140](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21140) Agree & (if
  applicable) implement approach to storing extension data for entities / tables
  ([11608](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11608))**

  This change makes it possible to extend Mailing with Custom data by making it
  so the Mailing api supports custom data. This is primarily for the benefit of
  extension writers.

### Core CiviCRM

- **[CRM-21659](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21659) Add hook to
  CRM_Utils_System::redirect ([11519](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11519))**

NOTE THIS PR HAS A BUNCH OF DOCUMENTATION ON IT MIGHT BE WORTH TALKING MORE ABOUT WHAT GUZZLE DOES? IM NOT SURE WHAT THIS LINE "The UriInterface from PSR-7 is included; the concrete implementation of Uri is loaded from Guzzle v6.3+." MEANS BUT IT SEEMS IMPORTANT

  Adds a hook (hook_civicrm_alterRedirect) when the browser is being redirected. This allows extensions to
  override the destination of an HTTP redirect.

  The UriInterface from PSR-7 is included; the concrete implementation of Uri is loaded from Guzzle v6.3+.

- **[CRM-21391](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21391) Refactor tasks
  to use a base class
  ([11808](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11808),
  [11761](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11761),
  [11762](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11762),
  [11763](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11763),
  [11760](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11760),
  [11759](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11759),
  [11758](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11758),
  [11692](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11692), and
  [11693](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11693))**

NOTE THIS IS A BIG CHANGE CODE WISE BUT MOSTLY KEEPS THINGS WORKING THE SAME... I THINK IT COULD BELONG IN THE BUG SECTION

  Refactors all the component tasks so they are extend a new base class
  CRM_Core_Task.

  This change cleans up the code and uses shared code where possible. It also
  fixes a few bugs specifically, there were a number of issues with the "Advanced
  Search" when switching between component types where the task list would be
  populated with the wrong list of tasks, but the keys would trigger an action on
  the selected component and an unexpected action may occur and there was also a
  bug where when saving group_type mailing_list was always being checked.


- **[CRM-21777](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21777) Improve the
  messaging related to Directories and Resources
  ([11802](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11802) and
  [11680](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11680))**

NOTE IM ON THE FENCE IF THIS IS A FEATURE OR A BUG

  This change makes it so when on the admin pages Directory Preference OR Resource
  URL fields initialized in civicrm.settings.php are loaded as readonly. Prior to
  this change the fields were being loaded as editable but the values were not
  being saved because they were being overridden by the values in the
  civicrm.settings.php file). This change also adds a warning which lets the user
  know that some fields are already set (overridden) in settings file.

- **[crm-](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/crm-)  ([11775](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11775), [11699](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11699), [11695](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11695), [11682](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11682), and [11677](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11677))**

NOTE THIS ONE IS BROKEN NOT SURE WHY NOT TOUCHING

- **Add pre and post hooks to the Survey entity
  ([11813](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11813))**

  This change makes it so hook_civicrm_pre and hook_civicrm_post are fired when
  a survey is saved.

- **[dev/core/issues/12](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/12) Added
  auto-scroll-up functionality between steps to crmUiWizard
  ([11790](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11790))**

  Adds auto-scroll-up functionality between steps in a wizard-driven workflow.

- **Fix style glitches ([11792](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11792))**

  and the form input for the extension.

- **Update minimum php version to 5.5
  ([11453](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11453))**

  ([11766](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11766))**

  Moves help section outside block and adds missing label.

- **CKEditor Advanced Options - Better validation of options
  ([11752](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11752))**

  In the "Advanced Options" of the CKEditor Configurator, api options can be
  selected. This tweaks the UI to prevent the same option from being selected
  twice, which would not make sense.

### CiviCase

- **[CRM-21558](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21558) Add batch
  update via profile to cases
  ([11411](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11411))**

  This change adds a "Update Multiple Cases" option to search tasks and allows you to batch
  update multiple cases in the same way as other entities.

### CiviContribute

- **[CRM-20610](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20610) Replace
  payment details block with editable payment list on 'Edit Contribution' form
  ([11748](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11748)) (preliminary
  work)**

  This change makes it possible via hook or by changing core to switch to using
  the payment form on the 'Edit Contribution' form for payments without actually
  making that change.

- **Fix transaction template
  ([11811](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11811))**

  Updated transaction template as per regular templates

### CiviMail

- **[CRM-21576](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21576) Implement Send
  SMS permission ([11590](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11590))**

  This change adds a permission to Send SMS. More specifically, it: Adds the Send SMS
  permission to CRM_Core_Permissions::getCorePermissions, ensures that all
  navigation menu entries ('Find SMS' and 'New SMS') respect the new permission,
  Ensures that all paths (civicrm/sms/send, civicrm/activity/sms/add,
  civicrm/mailing) respect the new permission, Only show 'Outbound SMS' action
  from the action menu on the contact screen to users with the send SMS
  permission, and only shows 'SMS - schedule/send' from the advanced search
  actions to users with the send SMS permission.

- **[CRM-21405](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21405) Allow
  "Outbound SMS" when Mobile is not primary phone number
  ([11252](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11252))**

  This change makes it so when a contact has a mobile phone number but it is not
  the primary number the "Outbound SMS" action is allowed, and usees the first
  available mobile number from the contact.

- **Add 'huge' class to html textarea to match plaintext textarea
  ([11770](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11770))**

  This change makes it so that the HTML Format input and the Plain Text Format
  input On the Message Template editor screen match.

### CiviMember

- **[CRM-21733](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21733) Allow
  overriding membership status temporarily until specific date
  ([11722](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11722) and
  [11622](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11622))**

  When overriding a membership status this change provides extra options to allow
  a temporary status override.

  Instead of having a checkbox called (Override Status?) in membership
  add/edit/renew form, it is replaced with a select box that allow the user to
  choose one of three options: No, Override Permanently or Override until selected
  date.

  If the first option is selected, then the membership will behave as if the old
  (Override Status?) is *unchecked*, which means that the membership is subject to
  membership status rules.

  If the 2nd option is selected, then the membership will behave as if the old
  (Override Status?) is *checked*, which mean that the membership status is
  overridden and is not subject to the membership statues rules.

  If the 3rd option is selected, then a new field will appear allowing the user to
  choose a date, in this status, the membership will behave similar to option 2,
  but when today date is equal or less than the selected date, then the "Update
  Membership Statuses" scheduled job will automatically convert its status back to
  *No*, which means that the membership status is overridden temporarily only for
  the selected date and after that it will revert back and be subject to
  membership status rules.

### CiviCRM Search

- **[CRM-21810](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21810) improve
  changelog search panel UI
  ([11729](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11729))**

  This change improve the change log panel in Advanced Search UI. It places the
  added/modified radio buttons at the top and moves the two search fields side by
  side to make the layout more logical and to make better use of the space.

### Internationalisation

- **[CRM-21765](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21765) Commit files
  to git which are static but are generated from CodeGen like DAO files
  ([11667](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11667))**

  Add SchemaStructure.php and langs.php files (which are static but generated from
  CodeGen) to git, reducing the need to run GenCode.

### Core CiviCRM

- **[CRM-21830](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21830) State/Province
  tokens are not working as expected in address settings for billing address
  ([11776](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11776))**

  When the 'state_province_name' token was used (in address settings), the
  state/province was empty when 'Billing Address' was displayed. This change
  makes it so when the 'state_province_name' token is used in address settings
  the token is populated when the billing address is displayed

- **[CRM-21781](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21781) Don't crash if
  contact ID not found when viewing contact
  ([11690](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11690))**

  In various situations if one ended up at civicrm/contact/view without URL
  parameters (for example logging back in after session expiry) a fatal error was
  thrown.

  This change makes it so that instead of throwing a fatal error one is bounced
  back to the Civi dashboard, improving the user experience.

- **[CRM-21826](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21826) Default FROM
  Email Address (for system-generated emails) link incorrect in System Status
  Screen ([11756](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11756))**

  numbering to 5.x.x
  ([11704](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11704))**

  This changes the version numbering to 5.x.x. Starting with 5.0.0, the second
  digit will increment with normal releases (typically monthly) and the third
  digit will increment if the release is a patch.

- **[CRM-21667](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21667) Bad timezone
  hand-off from CMS to CRM
  ([11800](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11800))**

  Resolves errors resulting from representation of timezone data in different
  formats. Now timezone data is converted from GMT offset in seconds to region
  string, as expected by related methods. This fixes taxes into account daylight
  savings time.

- **[dev/financial/5](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/21) If a currency
  has been disabled allow the form to be submitted
  ([11795](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11795))**

  Resolves bug where if you had contributions / recurring contributions in a
  specific currency and subsequently disabled that currency in CiviCRM settings
  one would no longer be able to submit forms with an "amount" element that added
  the currency as a frozen value (eg. recurring contribution updateSubscription)
  so that the form can be submitted, the record can be updated and a warning that
  the currency is disabled but still in use is issued.

- **[CRM-21806](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21806) Search builder returns no results ([11769](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11769), [11751](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11751), and [11746](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11746))**

- **Fix upgrade failures from zero value `trxn_date`
  ([11745](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11745))**

  Some longstanding CiviCRM installations would have upgrade failures going to
  4.7.19 or higher with the database error: "Incorrect datetime value:
  '0000-00-00 00:00:00' for column 'trxn_date'" This change fixes those values
  to be NULL prior to the query that causes the problem.

- **[CRM-21823](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21823) Change
  position of help div and fix structure glitches
  ([11750](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11750))**

  On Date settings, Localization, and memberships admin pages this change makes
  it so:  the help section sits out side form block, style is called with a
  class instead of inline style and buttons are wrapped with correct wrapper
  class.

- **CKEditorConfig - Fix double-escaped slashes
  ([11747](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11747))**

  The "Advanced Options" section of the CKEditor configurator allows user-input
  strings. Slashes were being escaped multiple times in that input. This fixes
  it.

- **[CRM-21817](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21817) Move help
  section outside crm block as per other pages
  ([11738](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11738))**

  to preserve consistency.

  set-version.php to generate upgraders for major/minor increments
  ([11731](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11731))**

  The utility, tools/bin/scripts/set-version.php, is used to generate
  boilerplate files for incremental updates. This change improves
  compatibility with the version realignment (5.x.x).

- **[CRM-21795](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21795) Fatal error:
  civicrm/CRM/Utils/System/Drupal.php on line 857

### Dedupe

- **[CRM-21766](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21766) Dedupe screen
  gives inappropriate confirm message when clicking on batch dedupe
  ([11670](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11670))**

  After doing a batch merge which resulted in a screen of conflicts, if you were
  to click on 'refresh list' you got a 'Do you want to leave this site? Changes
  you made may not be saved.' popup. This change removes that popup as there was
  nothing to edit.

- **[CRM-21773](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21773) CRM-20858 breaks merging multi-value custom groups ([11691](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11691))**

  [11498](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11498))**

  This change makes it so that the CiviCRM Print Preview pages are not indexed
  by search engines and this change makes sure Event Info pages are not indexed
  by search engines when the event is not public.

- **[CRM-21814](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21814) Add proper container to text ([11735](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11735))**

### CiviContribute

- **[dev/core/issues/21](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/21) Fix page layout for wordpress
  ([11827](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11827))**

  Reverses formatting change that caused a regression in 4.7.31 for the display
  of contribution pages in wordpress.

- **Add test for api money, fix net_amount calc
  ([11801](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11801))**

  Money values 5.000,77 & 5,000.77 were not being handled, they were being
  converted to '5' by mysql insert. This change handles these values by cleaning the money values in the api layer.

- **[CRM-20608](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20608) IPN
  thinks Paypal Pro is Standard
  ([11777](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11777))**

  This fixes an issue where the IPN interprets the IPN message as if it's Paypal
  Standard even when its Paypal Pro resulting in IPN notifications for recurring
  payments from Paypal Pro not being processed properly. The fix makes it so
  that all incoming PayPal Pro IPN notifications for recurring contributions are
  correctly recorded as payments in CiviCRM.

- **[CRM-21756](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21756) Editing
  Contribution (total_amount) does -not- update LineItem (line_total)
  ([11780](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11780))**

  Before this fix when we change the total amount of membership payment (or event registration), it
  doesn't update the corresponding line-item data, causing a data integrity issue.
  This fix makes it so that when editing a contribution for a membership payment or event registration
  the Total amount field is frozen and there is help text beside this field that
  provides instruction to perform the same task either by recreating the
  membership (or participant record) or using Lineitem Editor.

- **[CRM-21819](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21819) Do not load

  contributions (after the initial one).

- **ensure pdfFilename is set
  ([11702](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11702))**

  Before this change when downloading a PDF file receipt, the name you were
  prompted to save it as is not properly set. If it simply set to: .pdf.
  This change makes it so the downloaded file name is named after the invoice id.

### CiviContribute, CiviEvent
