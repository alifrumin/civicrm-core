### Core CiviCRM

- **Configurable quicksearch settings
  ([13039](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13039) and
  [13056](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13056))**

  This permits (some) custom fields to be added to quicksearch as searchable
  fields. By adding a setting in Search Preferences to configure the search
  fields in the quicksearch box in the menu bar.

- **Permit additional (freeform) relative date filters - e.g 'last 18 months',
  'last 45 days' ([12682](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12682))**

  This change adds support for a greater range of date options for relative
  searches (e.g last 45 days, last 18 months). It requires option values to be
  added by an extension or by an experienced admin, and has a limited UI.

- **Allow contribution search by recurring payment processor ID / Transaction ID
  ([12818](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12818))**

  This change adds three new fields to the contribution search form: recurring
  contribution transaction ID, payment processor ID and processor ID.

- **[dev/core#495](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/495) Migrate simple
  Preferences & Settings forms to using a Generic class.
  [13054](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13054),
  [13062](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13062),
  [13047](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13047),
  [13046](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13046),
  [13048](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13048),
  [13040](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13040),
  [13004](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13004),
  [13026](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13026),
  [13027](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13027),
  [13025](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13025),
  [12731](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12731),
  [12940](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12940),
  [13022](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13022),
  [13023](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13023),
  [12906](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12906),
  [12919](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12919),
  [12925](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12925) and
  [12960](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12960)**

  Introduce generic settings form (fully metadata driven) - this provides a
  supported methodology for extensions to add settings forms and to alter core
  settings forms (albeit not all core forms are converted to that point).

- **Add icons to contact summary tabs
  ([13018](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13018))**

  This change makes it so that an extension using hook_civicrm_tabset can
  specify icons for the contact summary tabs. If no icon is specified
  fa-puzzle-piece is used.

- **Extract selectedChild tabheader functionality and enable for Manage Events
  ([12747](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12747))**

  This takes the existing functionality of adding selectedChild= to a url for a
  tabbed page and makes it work across all the pages tabs. The tab will have an
  id of 'tab-x' where x is the thing to use after '='.

  This change adds the ability to link to a specific tab for an event (and
  generally cleans up the code related to linking to tabs).

### CiviMail
- **Adding [CiviMail Draft] on test mailing (for mosaico)
  ([12758](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12758))**

  This change adds the text [CiviMail Draft] to the subject of any email that is
  sent using the send test functionality.

### CiviContribute

- **Add validate api action for ContributionPage.submit
  ([12829](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12829))**

  This change makes it so that api calls using the action
  ContributionPage.submit check that the parameters are valid for the form.

### CiviReport

- **On reports make current employer available as a field for display
  ([12904](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12904))**

  This change makes it so that the field "Current Employer" is available as a
  column on reports.
