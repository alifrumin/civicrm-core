### Dedupe

- **[CRM-20841](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20841) Manual Merge -
  on_hold, is_bulkmail or signature information lost
  ([10630](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/10630))**

  When deduping contacts, on the merge form, this change makes it so that the
  on_hold, bulkmail and signature status are displayed with the email address.
  If there is a difference between the statuses of the emails being deduped the
  email row is highlighted as a conflict.

- **[CRM-20565](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20565) Better & more
  configurable dedupe lookups when adding a contact
  ([10341](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/10341))**

  When saving a new contact if an existing contact was found with a similar last
  name saving the form would be blocked. This change makes it so that the
  settings for what to dedupe new contacts on are more robust and so that the by
  default new contacts are dedupped by first name, last name and email.

- **[dev/core#160](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/160) Import Progress
  bar polls server too often
  ([12252](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12252))**

  This change sets the interval at which the import progress bar polls the server
  to be 5s rather than 5ms to improve performance.

### Core CiviCRM

- **[CRM-21120](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21120) Warn if no
  crypt functions available
  ([12215](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12215))**

  This change adds an alert when Mcrypt extension is not available.

- **[CRM-21821](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21821) navigationMenu
  hook should take account of weight attributes
  ([11772](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11772))**

  This change makes it so that hook_civicrm_navigationMenu accepts a weight
  attribute for menu items and places menu items in the menu accordingly. If no
  weight is specified items are added to the end of the menu as they were prior
  to this change.

- **[dev/core/#152](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/152) Remove
  AdvMulti-Select custom field type
  ([12267](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12267)) and
  ([12238](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12238))**

  This change removes the error thrown when the Advance Multi-Select widget
  (which has been deprecated since 2014) was selected.

- **[dev/core#162](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/162) Use checksum to
  access user dashboard
  ([12254](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12254))**

  This change allows contacts to access the user dashboard from a checksum link
  ex: /civicrm/user?reset=1&id=<contact_id>&cs=<contact_checksum>

- **Auto-open tagest fields
  ([12248](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12248))**

  This change makes it so that when opening a tagset widget the first 10 tags
  appear in alphabetical order. Before this change the select2 would wait for
  the user to type before showing any results.

- **[dev/membership#2](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/membership/issues/2) Add
  'membership start date' as an option when creating Scheduled Reminder based on
  Membership ([12114](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12114))**

  When setting up a scheduled reminder for a membership this change adds an
  option to send the scheduled reminder based on the "Membership Start Date".
  Additionally, when setting up a scheduled reminder for an event this change
  adds the options to schedule the reminder based on the "Registration Start
  Date" or "Registration End Date".

### CiviCRM Search

- **[CRM-21811](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21811) Optimize
  advanced search by relationship with target group for reciprocal relationship
  types ([11732](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11732))**

  This change improves performance of the advanced search page when searching
  for reciprocal relationships.

### CiviHR

- **[CRM-19948](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-19948) Store the
  Attachment uploader information
  ([11739](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11739))**

  This PR changes the Attachment API so that it saves the current logged in
  contact as the uploader of the file.

### CiviMail

- **[dev/mail#11](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/mail/issues/11) Add pre/post hook
  for CRM_Mailing_BAO_MailingJob
  ([12275](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12275))**

  This change adds a mailing job delete function with pre/post hooks.

### Core CiviCRM

- **[CRM-21769](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21769) Show
  unsupported locale for parsing warning only when when enabling address parsing
  ([11672](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11672))**

  This change improves the warning thrown when the Street Address Parsing
  setting is set to be an unsupported locale so that is is thrown when that
  change is made as opposed to anytime one goes to edit a street address.

- **[dev/report#4](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/report/issues/4) CiviReports
  issue with boolean fields
  ([12382](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12382))**

  This change fixes a bug where contact and membership reports displayed all
  boolean fields (Deceased, Do Not Email, Do Not SMS, etc) as yes regardless of
  their actual values so that these reports show the correct data for those
  fields.

- **Fix enotice when updating a custom group with is_multiple = 1
  ([12243](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12243))**

  This change fixes a bug where an e-notice was being thrown when updating a
  group with is_multiple = 1 so that no e-notice is thrown.

- **ensure that the indexed column is not an FK before deleting the index
  ([12241](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12241))**

  This change fixes a bug where when changing a custom field from searchable to
  not searchable, CiviCRM tries to remove the index. This causes a fatal error
  when the column is also a foreign key to another table because the index is
  needed for the foreign key so that civi checks if the column is not a foreign
  key before removing the index.

- **[dev/core#147](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/147) One of
  parameters is not of the type MysqlColumnNameOrAlias when using Non-ASCII
  display names. ([12226](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12226))**

  This change fixes a bug where using a display name for a location type with
  Non-ASCII text would result in a fatal error when searching using that
  location type.

- **[CRM-21553](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21553) can not update
  primary location type field details if same field available for other location
  types ([11407](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11407))**

  This change fixes a bug where a profile could not include a primary email
  field (or any field that uses location types) and a email field of any other
  location type so that a profile can include two fields one with the location
  type Primary and one with a different location type.

- **[dev/core#149](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/149) Fatal Error on
  customvalue get api
  ([12225](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12225))**

  This change fixes a fatal error when running the customvalue get api.

- **Only set defaults when creating a custom field (not when editing one)
  ([12240](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12240))**

  This change fixes a bug where when editing a custom field any empty fields
  would revert to the default values so that they revert to what they were saved
  as (empty).
  
### CiviCase

- **getCaseRoles not working when supplied relationship id.
  civicrm_relationship table name changed to alias name rel because its changed
  in the actual query
  ([12245](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12245))**

  This change fixes a bug in the getCaseRoles function so it works properly when
  supplied a relationship id

### CiviContribute

- **[dev/core#170](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/170) contribution
  detail report errors when soft credits column is exposed
  ([12287](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12287))**

  This change fixes a bug where on the Contribution Details Report if the Soft
  Credits column was checked the running the report would result in a fatal
  error so that running the Contribution Details Report with the Soft Credits
  column checked does not result in a fatal error.

### CiviEvent

- **[dev/core#189](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/189) Event Fees not
  loading when registering in back-end
  ([12333](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12333))**

  This change fixes a bug where when registering an event participant on the
  back-end the fee selections section did not load after the event was selected.

- **[dev/core#185](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/185) “Print selected
  rows” option missing in Event Participant listing dropdown actions
  ([12326](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12326))**

  This change fixes a bug where when a user ran a search for Event Participants
  and then checked some rows the "Print selected rows" option was not showing so
  that the "Print selected rows" option shows as expected.

### CiviMail

- **[dev/core#163](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/163) Disabled Groups
  used for mailings block access to mailing reports
  ([12277](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12277)) and
  ([12259](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12259))**

  This change fixes a bug where When a group that was used to send a mailing is
  disabled, access to the past mailing was blocked because mailingACLIDs only
  checked for enabled groups.

- **[dev/mail#12](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/mail/issues/12) Incorrect Total
  Count on mail summary report
  ([12247](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12247))**

  This change fixes a bug where the Mail Summary Report "Total Opens" field was
  showing the open count for all mailings so that it shows the open count for
  only the corresponding mailing.

### CiviMember

- **[dev/core#154](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/154) Can't edit
  related records when current employer has a pending membership
  ([12266](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12266))**

  This change fixes a bug where creating a relationship thru which a contact
  should inherit a membership to a contact with a pending membership resulted in
  a fatal error so that the relationship is saved successfully.

### Dedupe

- **Re-instate Dedupe limit functionality & fix select toggle functionality
  ([12305](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12305))**

  This change fixes two bugs when deduping contacts. First, it makes sure that
  the limit parameter passed in the url is respected and second, it makes sure
  the criteria parameter passed in the url is respected.

- **Fix non-display of conflicts after batch dedupe from dedupe screen
  ([12193](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12193))**

  This change fixes a bug where if a batch dedupe was run for all contacts (not
  'selected contacts only') conflicts were not displayed so that conflicts are
  displayed.
