### Core CiviCRM

- **Allow extensions to define CSS themes / Add a configuration setting for when
  to load custom CSS
  ([CRM-18792](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-18792) /
  [dev/core#378](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/378):
  [14551](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14551) and
  [12929](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12929))**

  Adds an option to the "Display Preferences" settings form to allow users to
  more finely tune when CiviCRM's css is loaded. On WordPress and Joomla two
  options are available the "Backend Theme" and "Frontend Theme", on Drupal and
  Backdrop, the administration screen "Display Preferences" presents a singular
  "Theme" option.

- **Clean up use of DAO::nullArray
  ([dev/core#1047](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1047):
  [14556](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14556),
  [14555](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14555) and
  [14550](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14550))**

  Improves code stability by removing the unnecessary function
  `CRM_Core_DAO::_nullArray`.

- **Consolidate handling of conflicts between the batch job and get_conflicts
  api ([14685](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14685))**

  This ensures that merge conflicts are stored during batch_merge to the
  prev_next cache with the same format as when the api calls get_conflicts, the
  code doing this wrangling is moved from the api to the BAO layer.

- **Improve protected field metadata
  ([14679](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14679))**

  Adds more robust metadata to fields protected by permissions in a format that
  can be directly passed into `CRM_Core_Permissions::check()`.

- **Move api_key read/write permission checks from api to BAO
  ([14660](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14660))**

- **Handle relative start & end dates passed to datepicker widget
  ([14632](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14632))**

  Adds some client-side logic to the datepicker widget that was previously done
  server-side. Paves the way for afform.

- **Update example dates from 2009 to current year
  ([14636](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14636) and
  [14635](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14635))**

- **Improve utilities & tests for working with js notation
  ([14588](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14588))**

  Removes dependence on an external library & improves robustness & accuracy of
  reading/writing js notation.

- **i18n - Improve multilingual popup for text and wysiwyg fields
  ([14578](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14578))**

  Fixes copying of values between multilingual popup and main form for wysiwyg
  fields and makes text fields larger in multilingual poupp.

- **Update Owner Membership ID label in reports to be Primary Membership to be
  more consistent with rest of system
  ([14585](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14585))**

  Changes the label of the Owner Membership ID in reports from "Membership Owner
  ID" to "Primary Membership".

### CiviEvent

- **URL support for some params in event search
  ([14477](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14477))**

  Event Search URL support for the params: sort_name, participant_status_id,
  participant_register_date_low, participant_register_date_high, and
  participant_register_date_relative. Date format is a string of numbers YmdHIS
  (ex: 20180101).

- **Add checklist-model angular module
  ([14634](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14634))**

  Adds the angular `checklist-model` library required by form builder.

### CiviContribute

- **Reduce deadlocks on inserting custom data by only using 'ON DUPLICATE' when
  it is not a new row
  ([14605](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14605))**

  Reduce deadlocks when processing contributions with custom data. This
  specifically makes the custom data insert sql more efficient.

- **Fix url support for receive_date_high & receive_date_low
  ([14594](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14594) and
  [14611](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14611))**

  As a part of a general standardization movement, adds Url support on the
  contribution search form for the following fields: receive_date_high=20180101,
  receive_date_low=20180909120000, contribution_cancel_date_high,
  contribution_cancel_date_low and invoice_number=9. Deprecates and continues to
  support the start date being passed to contribution search as
  "start=2018-01-01".
