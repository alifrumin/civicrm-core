### Core CiviCRM

- **Allow extensions to define CSS themes / Add a configuration setting for when
  to load custom CSS
  ([CRM-18792](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-18792) /
  [dev/core#378](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/378):
  [14551](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14551) and
  [12929](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12929))**

  Adds an option to the "Display Preferences" settings form to allow users to
  more finely tune when CiviCRM's css is loaded. On WordPress and Joomla two
  options are available the "Backend Theme" and "Frontend Theme", on Drupal and
  Backdrop, the administration screen "Display Preferences" presents a singular
  "Theme" option.
